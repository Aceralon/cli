Cli for Eru

### Commands

Use `cli -h` to show commands.

Now we implement those commands:

* deploy
* remove
* realloc
* lambda
* build

### Develop

Commands' source code in `commands` dir, you can define your own commands inside. Use `make test` to test and `make build` to build. If you want to modify and build in local, you can use `make deps` to generate vendor dirs.
